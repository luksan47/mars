# Mars

Mars is the [Urán 2.0](https://github.com/kovacsur10/uran) unified information system for Eötvös Collegium. It's a complete 
rewrite, therefore comes under a new name and repository. Only a few resources are migrated from the Urán system.

## Architecture

Urán is a Laravel based application. For more information, see the [official Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs).

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome from both developers and other volunteers. If you are a developer, checkout our
[Contribution guidlines](https://github.com/luksan47/mars/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.
If not, the easiest thing right now is catching up with our language files. You can find them
[here](https://github.com/luksan47/mars/tree/master/resources/lang). Each folder contains translations a specific
language, where in each file we assign the proper words/sentences to the keys we use in the code.
