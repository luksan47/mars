# Contributing guideline

## The basics

We use the [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/), to learn more about it, read the basics section of its documentation.
It's also good to check out the previous commits, to see how to implement that part or that. Might seem a lot first, but it's really easy,
thanks to Laravel.

## Development

We will get up a dev-server shortly, to try out your changes. Until you can try it on your local machine.
For OS X, [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/valet) gives a pretty smooth experience. Easy to download, easy to configure.
For Windows and Ubuntu, try [Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/homestead). Haven't tried it, but should work. :) 

## Keep it minimal

The main problem with Ur√°n 1.1 was its *reinventing the wheel* strategy. Laravel provides everything we need. Use it.
The other problem was the unnecessary features came before the most important ones. Therefore the now defined issues are minial, only
contain the necessary parts of the system. After these are done, we can change the world. But first, build it.

## Commiting

When you would like to make some change, assign an issue to yourself, only after that start working on it. If there's no issue, create one,
but remember the paragraph above. Keep it minimal. If something's not clear, write it under the issue. Feel free to create your own branch,
or fork the repo. When you are done with your changes, the commit message should be the Issue's title and it should be sent through a 
Pull Request. Also, feel free to review already sent in changes.
