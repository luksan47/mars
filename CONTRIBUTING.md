# Contributing guideline

## The basics

We use the [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/), to learn more about it, read the basics section of its documentation.
It's also good to check out the previous commits, to see how to implement that part or that. Might seem a lot first, but it's really easy,
thanks to Laravel.

## Development

For OS X, [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/valet) gives a pretty smooth experience. Easy to download, easy to configure.

For Windows and Linux the project has an example [Laravel Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/homestead) configuration which can be used for local development.

With these steps you should be able to run Mars on your machine:

1. Clone Mars: `git clone git@github.com:luksan47/mars.git`.
2. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). (Or other virtualization platforms supported by Vagrant. Don't forget to reconfigure the `provider` in the steps below if you do so.)
3. Follow the instructions in the [First steps](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/homestead#first-steps) section.
4. Copy `.env.homesteadexample` to `mars/.env` and `Homestead.yaml.example` to `Homestead/Homestead.yaml`.
. Modify the `Homestead.yaml` file by changing `/your/local/path/to/mars`.
5. Create ssh keys to `~/.ssh/homestead_rsa.pub` and `~/.ssh/homestead_rsa`. (You can use something like `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"`.)
6. On Windows add the `192.168.10.10  mars.local` host entry to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.
7. Run `vagrant up`.
8. Get a console to the virtual machine with `vagrant ssh`.
   * In the project root (`cd /home/vagrant/mars`) run `composer install` and `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`.
9. The project should be running at [mars.local](http://mars.local/).

The MySQL database listens on port 3306 in the virtual machine, 33060 is forwarded from the host. See credentials in `.env`.

We like to use [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) for development. You can get a free license if you are a student.
The project contains basic configuration for this IDE with the Homestead environment, just open the project root in PHPStorm.

You can even use XDebug with this setup. Turn on listening for remote debug connections in PHPStorm and use the [XDebug](https://xdebug.org) browser extension in your favourite browser.

## Keep it minimal

The main problem with Ur√°n 1.1 was its *reinventing the wheel* strategy. Laravel provides everything we need. Use it.
The other problem was the unnecessary features came before the most important ones. Therefore the now defined issues are minial, only
contain the necessary parts of the system. After these are done, we can change the world. But first, build it.

## Commiting

When you would like to make some change, assign an issue to yourself, only after that start working on it.
If there's no issue, create one, but remember the paragraph above. Keep it minimal. If something's not clear, ask your questions under the issue.
Feel free to create your own branch (if you are a contributor), or fork the repo.
When you are done with your changes, the commit message should be the Issue's title and it should be sent through a
Pull Request. Also, feel free to review already sent in changes. E.g.

```bash
# when you start working
git checkout masteryour_feature_branch
git pull
git checkout -b your_feature_branch

# add your changes

# when you are done
git add --all  # or only your changes
git commit # an editor comes up, the first line should look like: Issue #x: changed this and that
# add more information if needed
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/master # resolve conflicts if something comes up 
git push origin your_feature_branch

# open repo in your browser and you should see a Create PR option.
```
